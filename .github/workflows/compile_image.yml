# nyxbot's new distribution workflow  #
# =================================== #

# Define Name
name: Image Compiler

# Description:
#   This actions workflow was designed to compile our image and upload it to
#   the Github Container Registry. It also shells into our server and tells
#   it to update.

#
# ===== [ Triggers ] ==========================================================
#

# NOTE: Originally this was supposed to have an 'on_workflow' trigger so it
#       would only run after test passes. However there was no reliable way
#       to test this, so I ditched it. Now it just runs on tagged releases.
